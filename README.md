Here's a simple example of how the bot captures DTMF tones:

```python name=app.py
from twilio.twiml.voice_response import VoiceResponse, Gather
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/voice", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def voice():
    response = VoiceResponse()
    
    gather = Gather(input='dtmf', timeout=10, num_digits=1, action='/gather')
    gather.say('Please enter a digit.')
    response.append(gather)
    
    return str(response)

@app.route("/gather", methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def gather():
    response = VoiceResponse()
    digit = request.values.get('Digits', None)
    
    if digit:
        response.say(f'You entered {digit}')
    else:
        response.say('No input received.')
    
    return str(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
